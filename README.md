# LunarVim config

This repo contains my configuration files for [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/), setting up
an IDE for data science using Python and R programming language. This configuration includes
additional features such as ChatGPT integration, Tabnine code completion and markdown preview
for note taking, and can be easily extended to almost any other language with
appropriate plugins.
