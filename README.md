# LunarVim config

This repo contains my configuration files for [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) to set up
an IDE for data science using Python and R, and includes essential features such as
auto-completion, debugger, lsp, linter, formatter and git-integration. This configuration also
includes ChatGPT integration, Tabnine code completion and markdown preview for note taking,
and can be easily extended to almost any other language with appropriate plugins.
