# LunarVim config

This repo contains my configuration files for [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) to set up
an IDE for data science using Python and R. It includes essential features such as
auto-completion, lsp, debugger, linter, formatter and git-integration, and some additional
features, viz. ChatGPT integration, Tabnine code completion and markdown preview for note
taking. This configuration can also be easily extended to almost any other language with
appropriate plugins.
